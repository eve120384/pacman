# Rollback to Previous Version

Due to a critical bug in version 1.2.0 of the Pacman project, we are rolling back to version 1.0.0 until the issue is resolved. The game crashes after a few minutes whenever Pacman eats a power pellet, making it unplayable for most users.

## Rollback Command

To deploy the older version, run the following command:

```
/deploy 1.0.0
```

## Next Steps

We are currently investigating the issue and will provide a fix in the next release. Thank you for your patience!
